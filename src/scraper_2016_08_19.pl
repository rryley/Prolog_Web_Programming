% Cleanup and generalization of html parser program.
% Program description: Accept as input a file or URL, and extract
% specific components based on file extension (ie. PDF, jpeg, MP3, txt,
% etc), and save locally. User will have option to specify path and file
% name for each item, or accept default local file name, derived from
% component extension.
%
% Requirements: must be able to parse arbitrary HTML/XML and search for
% actual text element, or attribute, allow user to modify listing of
% data scraped and save results locally.
%
%   To start reading source, go to bottom of file to start procedure and
%   read in reverse order to this section.
%   To run program, at toplevel	enter '['path/to/scraper2.pl'].'
%   and	enter "start." at prompt.

Above prints out list in format I want, but I am not
able to pass data around correctly yet. Tags var remains uninstantiated
at end of recursion.

It appears I have to add an additional clause and variable and use a
tail recursive procedure, and unify the internal variable with my Tags
variable at the end.

Solution to try -- have collect_tags/3 call collect_tags/4 as in
collect_tags(List1,List2,[],Tags) and
collect_tags(List1,List2,Stack,Tags).

After first call, Arg 3 will have results pushed onto it as below and
will be a proper list. At termination, unify arg 3 with 4 to pass
results down stack.

Inspired by Prolog Programming in Depth, page 79 on list reversal.

% Case 3: Scheme instantiated, but not to http or https. Simply ignore
% and call again with tail of list. May have to pass both relative and
% absolute lists throughout recursion.
