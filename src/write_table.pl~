This works, but need to figure out how to get all solutions in a list.
between(1,10,N),
findall(Results,
        query_tag(DOM, //(div)/table/tbody/tr(N)/td(text), Results),
        Results).

doc(DOM), between(1,5,M), between(1,6,N),
    xpath(DOM,//(div)/table/tbody/tr(M)/td(N,text), Results).



From Prolog IRC
 forall(( Results = [Rank, Symbol, Name, BTC_Val, USD_Val, Vol_24_Hr,
                    Missing],
   query_tag(DOM, //(div)/table/tbody/tr(1)/td(text), Results)),
   write_results(Results)).

This works well:
between(1,6,N),
    query_tag(DOM, //(div)/table/tbody/tr(N)/td(text), Results),
    Row = [Rank, Symbol, Name, BTC_Val, USD_Val, Vol_24_Hr, Missing],
    Results = Row,
    true.
